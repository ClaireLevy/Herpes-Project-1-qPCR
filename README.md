# Herpes-Project-1-qPCR
These data are from qPCR of the ICP27 gene using RNA from vaginal explants and vaginal epithelial cells. This is the same RNA that was
used for the microarrays in the Herpes-Project-1 repository. Erik Layton from Jia Zhu's lab (FHCRC, VIDD) did the qPCR and the calculations
for fold change. He sent me the data on 9Mar16 in 2 excel files:
Epithelial cell data: 2016-03-07 florian lab cell culture.xlsx
Explant data: 2016-03-07 florian lab plate 1 explants.xlsx

Information about other files in the Herpes-Project-1-qPCR directory on the VIDD shared drive are in the Herpes-Project-1-qPCR_README.txt file. (J:\MacLabUsers\HLADIK SHARED\Projects\Herpes study\Herpes-Project-1-qPCR\Herpes-Project-1-qPCR_README.txt)
